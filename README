1.Number Guessing Game
---------------------

Project Name: "Guess the Number"
----------------------------------

Description:-
-------------

Develop a simple manber guessing gume where the computer randomly selects a mumber, and the player tries to guess it within a limited manber of attempts.
The game should provide hints to the player whether the guess is too high or too low. Start with a console-based version and optionally add a GUI.

Features:-
----------
>Random Number Generation: Generate a random number within a specified range.
>Player Input: Allow the player to input their guess via the console or a graphical input hox.
>Hint System:- Provide feedback if the guest is too high, too low, or correct
>Attempts Tracking: Limit the number of attempts and display the remaining attempts.
>Optional GUI:- If desired, create a graphical interface wing Tkatter or PyQt for user input and feedback.

Technologies Used:-
-------------------

->Python:- For core game logic and functionality.
---------
->Tkinter PyQt (Optional): For building a graphical user interface.
--------------


Learning Objectives:-
----------------------
>Learn to use Python for simple game development.
>Understand random number generation and user input handling
>Improve problem-solving skills and leam to provide feedback based on user input

2.To-Do List Application
---------------------------

Project Name: "Task Manager"
-------------------------

Description:-
------------
Create a to-do list application that allows users to add,edit,and delete task.
The appilicatin should also allow user to mark tasks as complete  and save the task list to a file.
Start with ha console-based version and optionally add a GUI.

Features:-
---------
>Add, Edit t and Delete Tasks: Allow users to manage their tasks through the console.
>Mark Tasks as Complete: Provide an option to mark tasks as done.
>Task List Display. Show the current list of tasks, along with their stutus (complete or incomplete)
>Data Persistence: Save the the task list to a file and load it on startup.
>Optional GUI: If desired, provide a graphical interface for managing tasks using Tkinter or PyQt.

Technologies Used:-
-------------------
->Python: For the core functionality and logic.
--------
->File Handling: To store and retrieve the task list.
---------------
->Tkinter/PyQt (Optional): For building a graphical interface.
------------------------


Learning Objectives:
--------------------

>Learn to build a simple task management application using Python.
>Understand file handling for data persistence.
>Gain experience in creating user interfaces and managing user input.

3.Hangman Game
--------------

Project Name: "Hangman Challenge"
-------------------------------

Description:-
------------
Develop a classic Hangman game where the player has to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The
game should display the current state of the word and the number of incorrect guesses remaining. Start with
a console-based version and optionally add a GUI.

Features:-
---------
>Word Selection: Randomly select a word from a predefined list.
> Player Input: Allow the player to input a letter guess via the console or GUI.
> Game State Display: Show the current state of the word with correct guesses filled in and remaining blank spaces.
> Incorrect Guess Tracking: Display the number of incorrect guesses remaining and the letters guessed so far.
> Win/Loss Conditions: End the game when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
> Optional GUI: If desired, create a graphical interface using Tkinter or PyQt for user input and game display.


Technologies Used:-
-------------------
->Python: For game logic and functionality.
---------
->Tkinter/PyQt (Optional): For building a graphical interface.
-------------------------


Learning Objectives:-
---------------------
> Learn to implement game logic and state management in Python.
> Understand user input handling and how to provide interactive feedback.
> Improve problem-solving and logical thinking by implementing win/loss conditions.

4.Random Password Generator
---------------------------

Project Name: "Secure Password Generator"
----------------------------------------

Description:-
-------------------
Create a random password generator that allows users to generate secure passwords based on specifiedcriteria (e.g., length, inclusion of numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters). 
Start with a console-based version and optionally add a GUI.

Features:-
-------------
>Password Criteria Selection: Allow users to specify the desired length and character types (e.g., letters,numbers, symbols).
> Random Password Generation: Generate a password based on the selected criteria.
> Display Generated Password: Show the generated password to the user.
>Copy to Clipboard: Provide an option to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
> Optional GUI: If desired, create a graphical interface using Tkinter or PyQt for input and output.


Technologies Used:-
--------------------
-> Python: For core functionality and password generation logic.
----------
-> Tkinter/PyQt (Optional): For building a graphical interface.
